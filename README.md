## Introduction

Bootleg Party is a mulitplayer online experience that was inspired by the popular Nintendo game Mario Party, but with an added nostalgic twist. Our goal is to have our users have a familiar board game experience incorporated with mini-games that pay homage to some of our personal favorites. Bootleg party is best enjoyed with 4 players, and can be played with as few as 1, but ultimately, it’s all about having fun.
